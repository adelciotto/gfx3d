# TODO

- [ ] Use gfx3d_type_t notation for struct typedefs.
- [ ] Use pipeline module for the entire graphics pipeline code.
- [ ] Simplify the main draw function and add code comments so it clearly explains each step of the pipeline. Like pseudocode from 3d math textbook.
- [ ] Have the geometry object contain a gfx3d_vertex_list_t SOA.
- [x] Window and Framebuffer.
- [ ] Debug text rendering.
- [x] Take in geo input and transform by model view mat.
- [x] Transform resulting vertices and project into screen coords.
- [x] Plot those vertices onto the screen.
- [x] Add specific vec3 type.
- [x] Assemble triangles from projected vertices.
- [ ] Add more types of common geometry.
- [ ] Wire frame draw mode.
- [x] Filled polygon draw mode.
- [x] Any issues with depth? Use z-buffer.
- [ ] Backface culling.
- [ ] Proper triangle clipping so that if statement in framebuffer set pixel is not needed.
- [ ] Calculate normal for pixel in rasterizer.
- [ ] Do some simple lighting.
